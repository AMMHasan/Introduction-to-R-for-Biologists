# Who am I?


I am a computational Biologist by practice and a Molecular Biologist by degree. I'm not that old (yet), but I have walked a diverse paths in research fields. I did my Masters in plant science and I was one of the twenty members of the core team involved in the first genome project in my home country. I did my PhD in bacterial genetics (from University of Edinburgh) and did my last pipetting in 2018. Now, I am a full-time computational biologist (Senior Research Associate at UCL Cancer Institute, London), deciphering the hidden gems in the vast datasets generated by interrogating cancer samples from prostate cancer patients.

I love teaching and got my fellowship from Advanced-HE (former Higher Education Academy). I am a Chartered Biologist recognized by the Royal Society of Biology. I also am involved in designing course curriculum in a university at my home country and often run online courses on Bioinformatics with BioTED, Bangladesh.
