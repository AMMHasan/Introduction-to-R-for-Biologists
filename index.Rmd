## Definition

**R** is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the **R** Core Team and the **R** Foundation for Statistical Computing. - Wikipedia

## Mini history

**R** is an open-source implementation of the S programming language, which was designed for statistical analysis. **S** was created by Rick Becker, John Chambers, Doug Dunn, Jean McRae, and Judy Schilling at Bell Labs around 1976. 
In 1991, statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, started on an implementation of **S** which had become the **R** programming language over time. In 1995, statistician Martin Mächler convinced them to make **R** a free and open-source software. The first official release came in June 1995. and  the first official "stable beta" version (v1.0) was released on 29 February 2000. R is supported by a huge community leevel contribution as it is upen source. 

## Installing R and RStudio

We will be using RStudio, which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of R. To my view, it is very handy working in RStudio environemnt, rather than using simply R. However, to use RStudio, we’ll need to install first the Base-R, and then RStudio software. Base-R is the basic software which contains the R programming language. Desktop version of both software are totally free and open source.
