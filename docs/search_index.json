S was created by Rick Becker, John Chambers, Doug Dunn, Jean McRae, and Judy Schilling at Bell Labs around 1976. In 1991, statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, started on an implementation of S which had become the R programming language over time. In 1995, statistician Martin Mächler convinced them to make R a free and open-source software. The first official release came in June 1995. and the first official “stable beta” version (v1.0) was released on 29 February 2000. R is supported by a huge community leevel contribution as it is upen source. 1.3 Installing R and RStudio We will be using RStudio, which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of R. To my view, it is very handy working in RStudio environemnt, rather than using simply R. However, to use RStudio, we’ll need to install first the Base-R, and then RStudio software. Base-R is the basic software which contains the R programming language. Desktop version of both software are totally free and open source. 1.3.1 To Install R 1.3.1.1 For Mac users Open an internet browser and go to www.r-project.org. Click the “download R” link in the middle of the page under “Getting Started.” Select a CRAN location (a mirror site) and click the corresponding link. Click on the “Download R for MacOS” link at the top of the page. Click on an appropriate link under Latest releases. Save the .pkg file, double-click it to open, and follow the installation instructions. Now that R is installed, you need to download and install RStudio. 1.3.1.2 For Windows users 1.3.1.3 For Linux users 1.3.2 To Install RStudio 1.3.2.1 For Mac users Go to www.rstudio.com and click on the “Download” tab on the top Click on “Download” button under RStudio Desktop. Click on the version recommended for your system (i.e. the latest Mac version), save the .dmg file on your computer, double-click it to open, and then drag and drop it to your applications folder. 1.3.2.2 For Windows users 1.3.2.3 For Linux users "],["who-am-i.html", "Chapter 2 Who am I?", " Chapter 2 Who am I?

However, it can be extended to four with the source panel opened (File &gt; New File &gt; R Script). You can reorder the windows / panels as per your wish. 3.1.1 Source window The source panel is where you create and edit your collection of codes in i.e. R Scripts. This is your script editor. You can save it in “.R” extension and reuse your codes later or in the case of sudden crush of your computer. As you type in your codes, make a habit of saving the codes (command + S or Ctrl + S) as you do with most of the text editors. However, you have to run the codes actively through the Console (coming next in the discussion). You can run the whole page of codes or a snippet of code from the source panel. There are many ways to run your codes from the Source panel through the Console. This could be with copy your codes and then paste on the Console and then hit enter. Or selectitng the code snippet that you wish to execute and clicking on the “Run” button on the top of the Source window. Alternatively, you can use the short-cut “Command + Enter” on Mac, or “Control + Enter” on Windows OS. 3.1.2 Environment / History (Connections / Build / Git etc) This panel contains several tabs and the number depends on whether you have installed/ loaded one or few packages. I will touch on only the Environment and the History tabs. The Environment tab of this panel shows you all the data objects (like vectors, dataframes etc) that you’ve created during the current R session . You can even double click on a loaded dataset on Environment tab and view in the Source panel, however, I won’t recommend this if the dataset is relatively sizable. The little broom on the top resets your environment and deletes the variables or data. The History tab keeps the commands that you used and can be reused by double click to execute, or shift + double click moves to the Source editor (R Script). 3.1.3 Console One can treat the Console Panel as the heart of RStudio. This is the default window in Base-R. You executes your R commands here actually. The Console works a is a prompt like a terminal in UNIX OS and let you check your codes interactively. Keep in mind that, when you turn off the RStudio, the Console deletes all the codes that you have executed in the current R session and when you reopen RStudio, you start with a fresh Console. 3.1.4 Files / Plots / Packages / Help I will go through these four tabls in this panel. However, sometimes you may have an aditional tab called Viewer. Files - Files tab showes you where you are and what are the contents of the directory, which is equivalent to folder in windows OS. You can also see the path of the working directory on the top. Let’s set your current directory - setwd(&quot;/Users/mahedi/Documents/Collaborations/UCL_CI/Introduction-to-R-for-Biologists&quot;) Plots - This tab shows the plots after generated. One cool and handy feature of RStudio is to have it integrated. You can go back and forth between plots using left and right arrow keys. Small broom resets your plots panel and deletes from the memory. You can either copy your plot to the clipboard or export as .jpeg or .pdf file. hist(rnorm(1000), main = &quot;Histogram of 1000 random numbers&quot;) Packages - R packages are bundles of functions generated by R users and released for others to use for free. Sometimes low weight data are embedded within. This list contains all the packages that are downloaded in this computer (or came as base packages with R). And the loaded packages are the ones with tick marks (checked). FYI, there are more than 19000 packages in CRAN, more than 2000 packages in Bioconductor. Help - Help tab provides the information regarding functions - detailed descriptions, usage, arguments etc. This utility can be summoned using the search box or by the ?function_name in the console. You can either type the name of a function in the search window, or use the code to search for a function with the name. "],["data-types-and-data-structures.html", "Chapter 4 Data types and data structures 4.1 Useful data types in R 4.2 Data structure 4.3 Import and export data 4.4 Manipulating data 4.5 Exercise", " Chapter 4 Data types and data structures In this chapter, we will cover the following topics - Data type Numbers Characters Logical Data structure Vector Matrix Array Data frame List Import and export data .txt .csv .xlsx Manipulating data 4.1 Useful data types in R There are different data types used in R. We will touch upon a few but heavily used data types in this class. These are namely - 4.1.1 Numbers: Numbers can be an Integers, or can be floating numbers (decimal numbers). They are recognized as simple Numeric data type in R. 4.1.2 Character: This type of data can be equivalent to categorical variable. In other programming language, this is equivalent to String or Text data type. Here in R, these can be nominal (just names) or ordinal (names with hidden order) variables. 4.1.3 Logical: such as True or False. These can be the result of a boolean operation. Let’s see an example - participant.ID Date weight.in.kg height.in.cm smoker Overall.health.condition BMI1_001 01/11/2021 55.5 172 No Intermediate BMI1_002 02/11/2021 45.0 165 Yes Good BMI1_003 03/11/2021 75.0 150 No Poor Here in the table above, participant.ID, smoker, Overall.health.condition columns represent character data type. Of them, participant.ID and smoker columns contain nominal data, while the Overall.health.condition represents the ordinal data type. The columns namely weight.in.kg and height.in.cm contain numeric data type. A very very important information - Categorical data (nominal or ordinal) in R are also called Factors. Sometimes, you need to detach this characteristic (i.e. being factors) from your data and convert it to merely character type for the sake of data handling. Overall.health.condition &lt;- factor(c(&quot;Intermediate&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot; )) Overall.health.condition ## [1] Intermediate Good Poor Good Poor ## Levels: Good Intermediate Poor #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Overall.health.condition &lt;- factor(c(&quot;Intermediate&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot;), ordered = F) Overall.health.condition ## [1] Intermediate Good Poor Good Poor ## Levels: Good Intermediate Poor #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Overall.health.condition &lt;- factor(c(&quot;Intermediate&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot;), ordered = T) Overall.health.condition ## [1] Intermediate Good Poor Good Poor ## Levels: Good &lt; Intermediate &lt; Poor #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Overall.health.condition &lt;- factor(c(&quot;Intermediate&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot;), ordered = T, levels = c(&quot;Poor&quot;, &quot;Intermediate&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;)) Overall.health.condition ## [1] Intermediate Good Poor Good Poor ## Levels: Poor &lt; Intermediate &lt; Good There are also complex data types, date data types etc, which we will not cover in this course. 4.2 Data structure There are few useful pre-defined data structures heavily used in R and there are user defined data structures as well (there are no limits in this case). We will discuss a few of the former class - 4.2.1 Vector: Let’s first think of a variable and value pair, like you have a variable x and it has a value of 2. Like what we write in R: x &lt;- 2, which means, we assign the value 2 to x. This is equivalent to a scalar. You can put more than one value in a variable, and then it will be equivalent to a vector: y &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5,6) Here we have used the combine function c() to create a vector. Vector can hold different data-types individually, that means, one vector can hold only one type of data (numeric or character or logical etc). Just remember, if you want to hold multiple elements (be it numeric values or characters), enclose them with the combine function (as above). Each of the component of the vector is called its Element. You can call or refer the elements individually or as a group using their positional index. The positional index starts from 1, which you can refer to as one-based indexing. For example, if you want to call or retrieve the first element of vector y, you can type in y[1]. Similarly, you can refer to the 4th element by typing in y[4]. If you want to refer to from 2nd to the 4th elements of y, you type in y[c(2,3,4)] or you can use y[2:4]. A useful tip - for sequential numbers, you can use a short-cut using colon sign in between the minimum and maximum values (inclusive) of the range. Like, for 1 to 100, you type in 1:100. 4.2.2 Matrix: A matrix is a two-dimensional (row and column) array of a single data type. Matrices are created using matrix() function. Think of you having 20 numbers, from 1 to 20 and you want to create a matrix with 4 rows and 5 columns. So you type in: myMatrix &lt;- matrix(data=1:20,nrow = 4,ncol = 5) myMatrix ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 5 9 13 17 ## [2,] 2 6 10 14 18 ## [3,] 3 7 11 15 19 ## [4,] 4 8 12 16 20 If you want to subset the matrix you can do it easily. Always remember, matrix is a m row by n column (m x n) structure which you define in R as [m,n] or [row, column]. If you want to choose the value in the first row and the first column (which also indicates numeric 1 in myMatrix), you type in myMatrix[1,1]. If you want to select first 2 rows and 2nd to 4th columns, you type in myMatrix[c(1,2), c(2,3,4)] or myMatrix[1:2, 2:4]. 4.2.3 Array: You can accommodate your data in more than 2 dimensions using an array. We will not cover it in this course. 4.2.4 Data frame: For you, data frame is the main data type that will have a vast utility in this course. You will import data in this format and manipulate data and export data in this format. Therefore, it’s imperative that you understand it very carefully. A data frame is a two-dimensional array. It is more general than a matrix and can contain different data types in it at the same time. However, each column contains a single data type (of course). The function to create a data frame is data.frame() and an easy way to create a data frame is myDataFrame &lt;- data.frame(column1, column2, column3)) Let’s see the same data frame again and observe carefully how it is done. participant.ID=c(&quot;BMI1_001&quot;, &quot;BMI1_002&quot;, &quot;BMI1_003&quot;) Date=c(&quot;01/11/2021&quot;, &quot;01/11/2021&quot;, &quot;01/11/2021&quot;) weight.in.kg=c(55.5,45,75) height.in.cm=c(172,165,150) smoker=c(&quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;) Overall.health.condition=c(&quot;Intermediate&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Poor&quot;) myDataFrame &lt;- data.frame(participant.ID, Date, weight.in.kg, height.in.cm, smoker, Overall.health.condition) myDataFrame ## participant.ID Date weight.in.kg height.in.cm smoker ## 1 BMI1_001 01/11/2021 55.5 172 No ## 2 BMI1_002 01/11/2021 45.0 165 Yes ## 3 BMI1_003 01/11/2021 75.0 150 No ## Overall.health.condition ## 1 Intermediate ## 2 Good ## 3 Poor Remember, each of the vector defining each column in the data frame has to be of same length. Now, if you want to subset the data frame as you did from matrix, you can use the same technique. For example, if you want to know the weight and height of first two patients, you type in myDataFrame[c(1,2),c(3,4)]. Interestingly in the case of data frame, you can use the column names to do that, like - myDataFrame[c(1,2),c(&quot;weight.in.kg&quot;, &quot;height.in.cm&quot;)] Further more, there is another level of flexibility for selecting a column information by using dataframe$columnName notation as in our case myDataFrame$weight.in.kg. Now, you can inquire what are the column names by utilizing colnames() function and for the row names - rownames(), of course. Here, in this case, we don’t have row names yet, but we can assign them with row1, row2 and row2 by typing in rownames(myDataFrame) &lt;- c(&quot;row1&quot;, &quot;row2&quot;, &quot;row3&quot;) Now, if we want to subset using row and column names, we can type in - myDataFrame[c(&quot;row1&quot;,&quot;row2&quot;),c(&quot;weight.in.kg&quot;, &quot;height.in.cm&quot;)] Important nomenclature alert: In the realm of statistics, we refer a row as an observation and a column as a variable. In the realm of data analysts, they are records and fields, respectively. And, in the realm of Machine Learning, they are examples and attributes, respectively 4.2.5 List: In R, List is the (arguably) the most complex data structure which can hold different data types and data structures. Even, a list can hold another list. We will not cover this data structure in this course. 4.3 Import and export data For this course, we will limit ourselves to import data from our personal computers. I have sent two different files to you - one with .txt extension and another with .csv. First we will deal with our example_data.txt file and to import it, we will use read.table() function. And for example_data.csv file, we will use read.csv() function. For exporting the file, we will use either write.table() function or write.csv() function. To deal with .xls or .xlsx files, we will touch on this topic when we discuss how to load packages, later. The basic mode of reading a tabular dataset is the read.table() function. There are few others, like read.csv(), read.csv2(), read.ftable(), read.delim() etc. There are some basic parameter that you should be careful on - file = /path/to/the/file header = the default is set to TRUE, however, if the data doesn’t have a column name, set it to false. sep = for read.table(), it is set to white space. For read.csv(), it is a comma. For read.csv2(), it’s set to a semi-colon. For read.delim() or read.delim2(), it’s is a tab \"\\t\". row.names = if there’s a column for row name (usually the first column in the raw data), specify with the column number and later get rid of that column using say, data[,column_number] &lt;- NULL # read a tabular dataframe Now, reading a csv file - What about excel files? #library(readxl) # list the sheets of the excel file #excel_sheets(&#39;Sample-Sales-Data.xlsx&#39;) #df &lt;- read_excel(&#39;Sample-Sales-Data.xlsx&#39;,sheet=&#39;Sheet1&#39;) How to check after each read-in? # dimension of the data # check the head or tail # apply str() and summary() function reading in files from the web - # from CRUK ML course How to write the output into csv, tab or xls files - # write.table() # write.csv() # library(xlsx) # df &lt;- data.frame(matrix(1:10)) # #write.xlsx(df, &quot;output.xlsx&quot;) 4.4 Manipulating data # use mtcars dataframe # selecting columns by numerical indexing or column names # implementing average of each columns, sum of each column, colSums etc # add NA value to the dataframe, check for NA using is.na() function and then do the same operations with na.rm=TRUE argument. 4.5 Exercise "],["r-plot.html", "Chapter 5 R plot 5.1 Basic plots in R", " Chapter 5 R plot 5.1 Basic plots in R 5.1.1 scatter Again, we will use the data frame (myDat) that we have created while importing the data from our computer and we will be using different columns to draw different graphs in this section. And, there are many types of graphs that you can plot using R, but we will cover a few of them in this class. The first one we will learn is scatter plot. You need two variables to draw it and basically you look at the relationship between these two variables using scatter plot. The function to do it is simply plot() x &lt;- mtcars$mpg y &lt;- mtcars$disp plot(x,y) plot(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$disp) plot(x,y) plot(x, y, xlab = &quot;miles per gallon&quot;, ylab = &quot;displacement&quot;, col=&quot;salmon&quot;, pch=19, lty =2, type = &quot;b&quot;) 5.1.2 bar plot The last type of graphs that we will cover today is the bar plot. If we want to know how many cars are there by the types of cylinders in the mtcars data type, we use the table() function. Then we use the bar plot to visualize the counts. counts &lt;- table(mtcars$cyl) barplot(counts, xlab = &quot;Number of cylinders in a car&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;, main = &quot;The number of cars by different cylinder types&quot;) 5.1.3 histogram The next type of graph we will cover is the Histogram. Histogram shows you the distribution of your data. For example you want to see the distribution of the displacement - hist(mtcars$wt) hist(mtcars$wt, breaks = 20) hist(mtcars$wt, breaks = 10, xlab = &quot;weight (1000 lbs)&quot;) abline(v=mean(mtcars$wt), col=&quot;red&quot;, lty=2, lwd=2) abline(v=median(mtcars$wt), col=&quot;blue&quot;, lty=3, lwd=2) 5.1.4 box plot The next type of plot is also very important to understand the distribution of your data, and that is a box plot. boxplot For example, if you want to see the distribution of the same weight of the cars using boxplot, the command is - boxplot(mtcars$wt, horizontal = T) Most importantly, you can look at the data compared to other variable as well. For example, if you and to look at the MPG values by car cylinders, here is the code - boxplot(wt~cyl, data=mtcars, main=&quot;Car weight Data&quot;, xlab=&quot;Number of Cylinders in a car&quot;, ylab=&quot;Weight (1000 lbs) of the cars&quot;) ## Exercise "],["r-programming-and-r-functions-for-the-beginners.html", "Chapter 6 R programming and R functions for the beginners 6.1 Control flow in R 6.2 User-defined functions in R 6.3 Exercise", " Chapter 6 R programming and R functions for the beginners 6.1 Control flow in R 6.1.1 If-else 6.1.2 while 6.1.3 for loop Topic: function, loops, conditional execution, scripting, basic plotting ## Functions ###### print(&quot;I am a good boy&quot;) # Here print() and sum() is a built-in R function ## [1] &quot;I am a good boy&quot; sum(3,7) ## [1] 10 # Fuunction without any argument printOnly &lt;- function(){ print(&quot;hi&quot;) } printOnly() ## [1] &quot;hi&quot; # Function with argument, like &quot;name&quot; printOnly2 &lt;- function(name){ print(paste(&quot;hi&quot;, name)) } printOnly2(&quot;Maria&quot;) ## [1] &quot;hi Maria&quot; # a &lt;- 2 # b &lt;- 3 # a+b # Function that returns a result upon calling add &lt;- function(parameter1, parameter2){ # the main action of this function result &lt;- parameter1 + parameter2 return(result) } add(4,33) ## [1] 37 ########### SCOPE ########## name &lt;- &quot;He is Rajib&quot; loc &lt;- &quot;He stays in Tangail&quot; stay &lt;- function(loc){ print(name) loc &lt;- &quot;He stays in Dhaka&quot; print(loc) } stay(loc) ## [1] &quot;He is Rajib&quot; ## [1] &quot;He stays in Dhaka&quot; # But, if you print &quot;loc&quot; now, see what happens...... print(loc) ## [1] &quot;He stays in Tangail&quot; ######### Scripting (or programming) with R####### ########## if else ####### # if(condition){ # do something # } # else{ # do the alternative # } a &lt;- 10 if(a == 1){ print(&quot;a is equal 1&quot;) } else { print(&quot;a is not equal 1&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;a is not equal 1&quot; # grade A: 8-10 # # grade B: 6-7 # # grade C:4-5 # # grade D: 0-3 grade &lt;- 5 # out of 10 # Here look at the usage of &quot;if else&quot; if(grade &gt;= 8 &amp; grade &lt;= 10){ print(&quot;Student1 got grade A&quot;) } else if(grade &gt;= 6 &amp; grade &lt;=7){ print(&quot;Student1 got grade B&quot;) } else if(grade &gt;= 4 &amp; grade &lt;= 5){ print(&quot;Student1 got grade C&quot;) } else{ print(&quot;Student1 for grade D&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;Student1 got grade C&quot; ####### while ##### # while(condition){ # execute some action # } # This will start an infinite loop # a &lt;- 10 # while(a &lt; 11){ # print(&quot;a is less than 11&quot;) # } ## Here look at the usage of 1) paste() functioon and 2) break a &lt;- 10 while(a &lt; 20){ print(paste(a, &quot; is less than 20&quot;)) a &lt;- a+1 if(a == 20){ print(&quot;Now a is equal to 20&quot;) break print(&quot;I have not obeying the break function&quot;) # when break is applied, this line will not be executed. } } ## [1] &quot;10 is less than 20&quot; ## [1] &quot;11 is less than 20&quot; ## [1] &quot;12 is less than 20&quot; ## [1] &quot;13 is less than 20&quot; ## [1] &quot;14 is less than 20&quot; ## [1] &quot;15 is less than 20&quot; ## [1] &quot;16 is less than 20&quot; ## [1] &quot;17 is less than 20&quot; ## [1] &quot;18 is less than 20&quot; ## [1] &quot;19 is less than 20&quot; ## [1] &quot;Now a is equal to 20&quot; ######### for loop ##### a &lt;- 1:10 b &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;) # looping through the contents of a vector directly for(i in b){ print(i) } ## [1] &quot;a&quot; ## [1] &quot;b&quot; ## [1] &quot;c&quot; ## [1] &quot;d&quot; ## [1] &quot;e&quot; # looping through sequential numbers.
